# Smart pointer

A smart pointer is a data structure that not only points to an object
in memory but also provides additional features, such as
dynamically allocating memory as required or reference counting.

By encapsulating these responsibilities, smart pointers can help
ensure memory safety and reduce the likelihood of programming
errors, such as memory leaks or dangling pointers.

In Rust, smart pointers are an essential tool for safe and efficient memory management while adhering to Rustâ€™s
ownership rules.

For example:
String, Vec<T>
