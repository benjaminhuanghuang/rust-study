## Cargo.lock

To library: Leaving out the Cargo.lock file allows downstream packages to
update indirect dependencies as needed.

For applications, itâ€™s recommended you always include Cargo.lock alongside
Cargo.toml. This helps to ensure consistent behavior in published releases, should
third-party libraries change in the future.
