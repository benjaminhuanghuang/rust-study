# Write Idiomatic Rust

## Follow Conventions

- snake_case for variable and function names,
- PascalCase for structs, enums, and traits
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.

Align with Rust's community style by using tools like rustfmt to format your code.

## Modularize Your Code

## Leverage Enums and Pattern Matching

Use enums to represent states or variants instead of strings or integers.
Use match statements for exhaustive and clear handling of variants.

## Use Error Handling Idioms

## Use Iterators Effectively

## Document Your Code

rite clear and concise documentation comments using ///.
Include examples in docs using /// and //! for module-level comments.
Use tools like cargo doc to generate and review documentation.
