Crate is a collection of Rust source code files.

Binary crates compile to produce an executable program

Library crates contain code for other programs to use
The code in libs can be accesse in whole crate
```
  <catr>::<funcation>()
```


By default, all the variables and functions in a module are private, which means they are accessible only to other code within the same module.
