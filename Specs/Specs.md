# Specs: A Parallel ECS Library for Rust

Specs is an Entity-Component-System (ECS) library in Rust, designed for high performance, parallel processing, and flexibility.

In the context of Rust, SPECS (Storage Processing Entity-Component System) is a high-performance, parallel
Entity-Component System (ECS) library used for game development and simulations.

## ECS (Entity-Component-System)

ECS (Entity-Component-System) is a design pattern widely used in game development and simulations.

It provides a way to manage game objects efficiently by breaking them down into three main parts:

- Entities: Unique IDs representing game objects (e.g., a player, enemy, bullet).
- Components: Data containers that define an entityâ€™s properties (e.g., position, health, velocity).
- Systems: Logic that processes entities with specific components (e.g., movement system updates positions).
