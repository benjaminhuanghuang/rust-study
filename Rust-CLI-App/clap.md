```

Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
clap = "2"
```

## Run

cargo run -- --help

## Optional argument

the -n is an optional argument because you can leave it out

program options common to have short names with one dash and a single
character, like -h for the help flag, and long names with
two dashes and a word, like --help

## positional arguments

positional arguments's position relative to the name of the program (the first
element in the arguments)

## flag argument

The options -n and -h are often called `flags` because
they donâ€™t take a value. Flags have one meaning when present
and the opposite when absent
