# Graph in Rush

Dijkstra algorithm, breadth first search and depth first search

## Terminology

Vertices and edges

Adjacent vertices: two vertices are connected by an edge

Degree of a vertex: number of edges connected to the vertex

Path: a sequence of vertices connected by edges

Connected graph: there is a path between every pair of vertices

Complete graph: there is an edge between every pair of vertices

## Types of Graph

- Undirected graph: edges have no direction
- Directed graph: edges have direction
- Unweighted graph: edges have no weight
- Weighted graph: edges have weight

## Representations of Graph

- Adjacency matrix: A 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in the graph.

- Adjacency list

## Depth First Search

1. Start from a vertex
2. Make sure to track the visited vertex
