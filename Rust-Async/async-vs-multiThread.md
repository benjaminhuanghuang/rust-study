# Async Programming vs Multi Thread

Programming Rust Fast, Ch20 Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous tasks are similar to threads, but are much quicker to create, pass control amongst themselves more efficiently, and
have memory overhead an order of magnitude less than that of a thread. It is perfectly
feasible to have hundreds of thousands of asynchronous tasks running simultaneously in a single program.
