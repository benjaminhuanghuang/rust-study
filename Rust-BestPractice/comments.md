# Comments in Rust

In Rust, comments are crucial for explaining your code and making it more understandable. They can be categorized into non-doc comments and doc comments.

- Non-doc Comments
  Single-Line Comments
  MultiLine Comments

  Non-doc comments are used to annotate your code without being part of the documentation generated by tools like rustdoc. They are primarily for developers working directly with the code.

- Doc Comments
  Outer doc comments
  Inner doc comments

Doc comments are used to document public APIs and generate documentation using tools like rustdoc.
They start with /// for outer doc comments and //! for inner doc comments.

Outer doc comments are placed before functions, structs, or modules and are used to describe them in the generated documentation.

Example:

```rs
/// This function adds two numbers and returns the result.
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  a + b
}
```

In Rust, inner doc comments are a type of documentation comment that applies to the enclosing item (such as a crate, module, function, or struct).

```rs
//! This is documentation for the entire crate.

/// This struct represents a user.
pub struct User {
    pub name: String,
    pub age: u8,
}
```
